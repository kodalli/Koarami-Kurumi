# Koarami Kurumi

## What?
Koarami Kurumi is an AI VTuber project.

## Why?
She is designed to make my life less boring and sell my games Corpa.

## Name?
I combined "Koara" (コアラ), the japanese word for koala, with "mi" (耳), meaning ears because I am a koala and I'd like to believe she likes her koala creator. Also, she wears a koala onesie with fluffy ears. There's a hidden pun too "ram" refering to the GPU RAM required to run her.Kurumi (くるみ) is the Japanese word for walnut, and it represents her favorite snack. It's also a nod to my name KEKW.
